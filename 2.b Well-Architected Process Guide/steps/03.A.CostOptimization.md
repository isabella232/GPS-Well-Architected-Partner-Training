# Cost optimization review

The Well-Architected Assessment is a top-down review of your workload to
identify what could be improved in your architecture. In this step we will start
focussing on the costs of your workload, what are the most common pain points
and how to improve them. We will be doing this work in three levels, so you can
go deeper if you want. This will help on the most immediate and direct impact
of the recommendations.

## Level 1 - Cost Management, Sizing and Reservations

## Level 2 - Resources and Locations

## Level 3 - Architecture changes
