# Review your workload

During the prerequisites you wrote down your workload profile, now let's try to do a mind map and a stakeholder analysis of your workload. We have prepared a template to fill with all the information that you will find in the resources area.

## Describe the workload

Gather the most important technical details of your workload. Some topics usually are:

* Development platforms and programming languages used
* External services needed (dependencies)
* Provided connectors (dependent services)
* Data: databases, storage, sources
* Deployment tools
* How do you capture logs and other metrics
* Special infrastructure and network requirements (VMs, containers, VPNs, Hybrid scenarios, ExpressRoute, network appliances)
* Are all these points covered in the architecture diagram?
* Does the architecture diagram show all the Azure resources used?


## Create a Responsibility Assignment Matrix

[The matrix][raci] is a table that shows the roles and responsibilities of each team member, using the following role distinctions: [R]esponsible, [A]ccountable, [C]onsulted, [I]nformed.

| **Phase/Stakeholder** | **CTO** | **Team Lead(s)** | **Solution Owner** | **Project Manager** | **Developers** | **Infra Architect** | **Data Architect** | **Security Architect** | **Operations** | **Management** | **Other** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discover |
| Analyze |
| Prioritize |
| Design |
