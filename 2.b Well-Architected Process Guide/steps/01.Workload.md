# Review your workload

During the prerequisites, you wrote down your workload profile, now let's try to
do a mind map and a stakeholder analysis of your workload.

## Describe the workload

Gather the most important technical details of your workload. Some topics
usually are:

* Development platforms and programming languages used
* External services needed (dependencies)
* Provided connectors (dependent services)
* Data: databases, storage, sources
* Deployment tools
* How do you capture logs and other metrics
* Special infrastructure and network requirements (VMs, containers, VPNs, Hybrid
scenarios, ExpressRoute, network appliances)
* Are all these points covered in the architecture diagram?
* Does the architecture diagram show all the Azure resources used?

> :pill: If you still don't have an architecture diagram, try to make one using
any tool like [Visio][visio] or [Draw.io][drawio] that already contain a
full set of the Azure Icons, or you can [download them][azureicons] to use with
your favourite tool.

## Create a Responsibility Assignment Matrix

[The matrix][raci] is a table that shows the roles and responsibilities of each
team member, using the following role distinctions: \[R\]esponsible,
\[A\]ccountable, \[C\]onsulted, \[I\]nformed.

| *Phase/Stakeholder* | **CTO** | **Team Lead(s)** | **Solution Owner** | **Project Manager** |**Architect** | **...** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discover |
| Analyze |
| Prioritize |
| Design |

## Resources

These are some tools you can use during this first step:

* [Mind map][mindmap]
* [User Journey map][userjourney]
* [Value Proposition Canvas][vpcanvas]
* [RACI][raci]

## Checkpoint

---

* [ ] Workload technical description (mind map or bullet points)
* [ ] RACI matrix

When you have finished these two tasks, continue to the
[Information Collection][2] step.
