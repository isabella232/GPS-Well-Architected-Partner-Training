# Reliability review

When reviewing the Reliability pillar you typically start with the business
requirements of the application. Try to ask the questions:

* How critical is the application?
* What would happen if the application went down?
* Is it a custom solution or provided by a software vendor?
* What are the SLAs targets?
* Does the customer have a risk analysis?

## Level 1 - Composite SLA, SPOF and HA

## Level 2 - BCDR, Detection & Response

## Level 3 - Design Patterns
